An attempted revision of my 1-bit encoder that went absolutely nowhere.

This was intended to be a revision of a 1-bit encoder using compiler intrinsics, however, this ended up going nowhere, since I had (and still have, as of time of writing, which is 2022-10-08) essentially no instruction extensions knowledge.
